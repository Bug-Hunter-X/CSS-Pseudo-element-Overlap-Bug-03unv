The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue where the `::before` pseudo-element's content unexpectedly overlaps with the main element's content. This happens because of incorrect z-index settings or lack of proper stacking context.

```css
.container {
  position: relative;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container::before {
  content: "Hello!";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-color: lightcoral;
  z-index: 1;
}
```

The `::before` element should ideally appear on top, but due to the lack of proper z-index management or a missing stacking context, it overlaps the main content unexpectedly.
